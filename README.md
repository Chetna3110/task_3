# 🏠 Housing Price Prediction using Linear Regression

This project uses a **Linear Regression model** to predict housing prices based on various features from the Housing dataset. It demonstrates a complete end-to-end Machine Learning workflow, including data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization.


## 📁 Dataset

The dataset used is `Housing.csv`, which contains information about houses such as:
- Number of bedrooms
- Number of bathrooms
- Area (sq ft)
- Furnishing status
- Presence of amenities (parking, air conditioning, etc.)
- Location (encoded)

## 📌 Objective

To build a Linear Regression model that:
- Predicts house prices.
- Evaluates model accuracy using MAE, MSE, and R².
- Visualizes results and interprets model coefficients.
